## The dillonchristensen.com API for all things fun.

The goal here is to unify all apps I have running across platforms to have one central API that does my bidding. I've had Kowalski running for a while now and I love the things he does, but I've been getting more interested in Open Source lately which has me expanding my horizons. So I thought it'd be wise to create a central API that does the heavy lifting and then have my slackbots/websites just share a resource for getting that sweet data.

## TODO:
* **all of it**
* Kowalski features (bookmancy, fired, gdq, paycheck, budget)
* Kalibot lunch places
* make more todos
